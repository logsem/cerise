(** This file is a tutorial to learn how to use the Cerise Program Logic within Coq.
    We will use the modularity of the program logic to use the specification of
    a macro in a program, and show how the macro can be linked via a linking table.

    Prerequisites:
    We assume the user has already followed the first part of the tutorial
    "cerise_tutorial.v" and is able to prove the specification of a program
    with known code using the Cerise Proof Mode. *)

  (** The increment macro is a macro that takes a register r (r ≠ r_env), which
      contains a capability C with a permission p ≤ RW, that points to
      an integer n. The macro increments the value of the integer.
      The macro uses the register r_env to perform the arithmetic, and clear
      the result of the register.

  (** The increment macro is just a list of instructions. In particular,
      it can be used as a part of a bigger list of instructions.
      The specification assumes that the PCC points to the first address of the
      macro, and the list of instructions is _included_ into the bounds of the
      PCC: thus, the specification can be used in the proof of the specification
      of a bigger program.

      The macros are a way to define the program modularly.
      For such short macro, the modularity is a bit "too much", but dealing
      with larger and complex macros (e.g. involving a loop), this modularity
      is necessary.
   *)

  (** The following is a very simple example of program that uses the macro. The
      program assumes that R0 contains a writing capability pointing to the
      memory. It initializes the value of this memory address at 0, calls the
      increment macro to increment the value, and finally loads the
      incremented value in the register R1.

      The reader may notice 3 blocks of instructions, separated by the `++`
      operator. The proof will leverage this block separation using new
      `focus_block` tactics, detailled in `proofmode.md`, section `Focusing a
      sub-block`. They allow us to focus on a block, prove its specification
      locally, and then continue the proof of the global program.

  (** **** Exercise 3 --- Secret addition
        Define the lemma `secret_add_spec` that specifies the program
        `secret_add_instrs` and prove it.

        Use the tactics to focus and unfocus the block.
        The specification of the `rclear` macro is `rclear_spec`,

        Hint (specification): TODO ???
        Hint (proof): The specification of `rclear` requires the use of
        the `big_sepM` resource. The `big_sepM` resource [...] use a map.
        We urge the reader to search lemmas about `big_sepM` and

  (** Outline
    2 steps:
    1. use the macro in the middle of the code (as a real macro)
    2. capture the macro into a sentry-capability (as a function), and use a linking table

    1.1) Demo
    Define a program that use this specification that do the following:
    - takes a capability input
    - store 0 into it
    - use the increment macro

    1.2) Exercise
    Exercise with the rclear macro: specify and prove

    2.1) Demo
    Same program as 1.1, but the increment macro is reachable via
    the linking table (instead of inlined).
    It requires some boilerplate about the linking table and shows
    how to set it up.

    2.2) Exercise
    At last exercise, the reader should be able to use the Cerise macros,
    so why not a program that does the following:
    - dyn alloc a region of memory with malloc
    - stores 42 in the last adresse
    - assert it is 42

    Finally, list the macros available in Cerise *)


  (** Now that you are familiar with the Cerise Proofmode,
      we recommand to try defining a program by yourself, as
      well as its specification.
      We also recommand to continue the tutorial with
      TODO (next file) to learn how to define the specification,
      how to use the logical relation to reason with unknown code,
      and how to deal with local encapsulation, using the call macro.
